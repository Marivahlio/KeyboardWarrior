"Keyboard Warrior" was a side project I started to see if I could create fun gameplay with unconventional controls.
I had some ideas, but while working them out they all just quite didn't seem fun.
I did however, create one idea, which is a game you control with 40 keys on the keyboard... yeah.
It's more of a small little puzzle than a game, but I'm happy with the visuals and effects.
